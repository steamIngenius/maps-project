# Neighborhood Maps Application

## How will I complete this Project?

1. Review our course [JavaScript Design Patterns](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud989-nd).
1. Download the [Knockout framework](http://knockoutjs.com/).
1. Write code required to add a full-screen map to your page using the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/).
1. Write code required to add map markers identifying a number of locations your are interested in within this neighborhood.
1. Implement the search bar functionality to search and filter your map markers. There should be a filtering function on markers that already show up. Simply providing a search function through a third-party API is not enough.
1. Implement a list view of the identified locations.
1. Add additional functionality using third-party APIs when a map marker, search result, or list view entry is clicked (ex. Yelp reviews, Wikipedia, Flickr images, etc). If you need a refresher on making AJAX requests to third-party servers, check out our [Intro to AJAX course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud110-nd).
